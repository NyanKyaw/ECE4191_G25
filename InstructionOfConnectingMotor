           R-Pi-4GPIO-Pinout

1. connect power supply to VIN and GND pins on the TB9051FTG carrier(voltage 5v). (should I use power from Raspberry?)
2. connect the two terminals of the DC motor to the OUT1 and OUT2 pins on the TB9051FTG carrier.
3. connect a GPIO pin from the Raspberry Pi to the PWM pin on the TB9051FTG. 
This will be used to control the speed of the motor. (We use GPIO 18 for this)

4. connect a GPIO pin from the Raspberry pi to the DIR pin on the TB9051FTG.
This will be used to control the direction of the motor. (We use GPIO 23 for this)

5. connect a GND pin from the Raspberry pi to a GND pin on the TB9051FTG. (To ensure a common ground)
6. notice the motor has 6 pinouts

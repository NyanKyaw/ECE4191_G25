           R-Pi-4GPIO-Pinout

1. connect power supply to VIN and GND pins on the TB9051FTG carrier(voltage 5v). (should I use power from Raspberry?)
2. connect the two terminals of the DC motor to the OUT1 and OUT2 pins on the TB9051FTG carrier.
3. connect 2 GPIO pins from Raspberry Pi to the PWM1 and PWM2 pins on the TB9051FTG. These will control
the speed and direction of the motor. (choose GPIO 18 for PWM1 and GPIO 23 for PWM2)

4. connect a GND pin from the Raspberry Pi to a GND pin on the TB9051FTG. (To ensure a common ground)
5. notice the motor has 6 pinouts

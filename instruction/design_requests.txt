1. Is there a minimum parcel dimension? 
  Not sure yet, probably about 5cm.

2. Is there a time limit on delivering a parcel once it has been loaded?
  NO

3. How long will we have to deliver parcels?
  Probably around 5 mins total per round, may vary down the line depending on scheduling.

4. Angus McLennan:
Hello everyone, our group (group 10) is going to design a robot that follows the wall. If anyone is doing the same, PLEASE GO CLOCKWISE!!

5. Will there be obstacles within the arena during Milestone 1/2?
  For milestone 1 yes, for milestone 2 no

6. How much voltage do the encoders on the motors use? 5 or 3.3v?
    You can find a datasheet at https://www.pololu.com/product/4846/resources

7. Do parcels need to be delivered by a specified robot?
    No

8. Hi, the requirement for the project is to pick and drop or only drop the parcel?
    Hi Dhruv, you can place the parcel onto the robot yourself within the loading zone, so it is mainly to drop the parcel off at the correct goal.

9. If we were to decide within the team of two robots, that one was to deliver only to zones 1 and 2, and the other was to deliver packages only to zone 3, is that allowed?
  Hi Grant, that is fine if you communicate this across to the team you are working with. Just note that this may slow down your delivery system as we provide only a batch of parcels at a time

10. Can the robot touch the walls of the arena?
    please see the rubric for milestone 2 for collisions penalties. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-XoAi_h6sWWVySI017KD9s9TJiazB_5j_SDpMBxZS7s/edit?usp=drivesdk
